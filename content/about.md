## Is it just for Front-end Developers?

No.

We are a welcoming community of developers meeting in the centre of York, the meetup is called Front-end York but that doesn't mean its only open to front-end developers, instead we focus on talks about front-end technology stacks, but also cover all topic areas of interest to developers.

## What topics do you cover?

So the answer really is that we are a community driven event, meaning we are led by the topics that our community tells us they are interested in - so on that note please email or DM us with any suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered.

That list so far includes:

* Accessibility and an inclusive web
* Styling technologies (CSS, etc) & frameworks
* JavaScript
* Code control
* Hosting technologies (with an eye towards serverless infrastructures)
* UI design, responsive technologies, mobile experiences
* User experience, research and data visualization
* Workplace culture and experiences
