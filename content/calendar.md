description: We meet the first Wednesday of the the month
---

We aim to meet on the first Wednesday of every month, please see our calendar of events below.

### November 6th

Instead of a November meeting we are forming part of the York Tech Fest - an event highlighting the range of technical meetups within York.

### December 4th

We have a great couple of talks lined up to end the year - details coming soon.

### February 5th

We are not holding a meetup just after Christmas and New Year as we think people will probably need a little while to ease themselves back into real life.

However we have one talk lined up and are just looking to fill the final slot.

### March 4th

We are on the lookout for speakers for our March event - if you are interested then please see our Information for Speakers below.
