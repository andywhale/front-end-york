We aim to meet on the first Wednesday of every month, please see our calendar of events below.

#### October 2nd

See details from our [October Javascript special](https://www.meetup.com/YorkDevelopers/events/265085707/) over on meetup.

#### November 6th

Instead of a November meeting we are forming part of the [York Tech Fest](https://yorktechfest.github.io/) - an event highlighting the range of technical meetups within York.

### December 4th

We have a great couple of talks lined up to end the year - details coming soon.

#### February 5th

We are not holding a meetup just after Christmas and New Year as we think people will probably need a little while to ease themselves back into real life.

However we have one talk lined up and are just looking to fill the final slot.

#### March 4th

We are on the lookout for speakers for our March event - if you are interested then please see our Information for Speakers below.


## Information for Speakers

If you have a talk lasting somewhere between thirty and forty five minutes that would be of interest to a room full of devs or people looking to get into web development then please get in touch either e-mail us or DM us on twitter.

See our [about](/about/) section to see some of our key areas of interest.
